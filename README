Used this program as a reason to learn how to deal with time structures, and 
various things in time.h. sys/time.h is another header to look at.

Also used this program to learn how to use dirent structures, and access
directories in the linux system.

This program,

gets time information,
gets PID information from proc/
gathers a pseudo generated random number
does random bitwise things i threw in for fun.

returns a random number based on the mod value passed.

Not really 100% practical, but was a fun learning exercise.

Was my first time ever touching pthreads aswell.

Again, this was just to play around with new libraries and new functions and
see how things tick! The threading is not worth it as the overhead for the 
threads outweights their task drastically.
